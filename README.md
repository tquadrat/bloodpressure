# Introduction

# Limitations

That is because the UI is built on base of JavaFX, and this relies on a bunch of platform specific libraries.

Currently, the [provided Tar file](https://tquadrat.githup.io/bloodpressure/build/distributions/org.tquadrat.shootingtime-0.0.1-amd64.tar) works for x64 Linux only. The provided Zip file is intended for Windows, but it does not work on that platform.

I need to create builds for all platforms (Linux x64, Raspberry PI and Windows), but this is currently work in progress.
